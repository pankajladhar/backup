Setup:
  1. Extract project
  2. `npm install` in project directory
  3. node server.js

Uses Express to serve the static JSON responses to API requests (see server.js)

Note to the evaluators:

  Features not implemented:
    1. Slider not implemented
    2. Search results are static. One JSON reponse for 'one-way' trip and another for 'return'. Form values don't matter.

  Focused on:
    1. Meaningful markup
    2. Minimal, es6 based JS abstractions for the app
        a. Not using any framework like Ember/Angular. Wanted to write something from scratch.
        b. App is organized as heirarchy of components beginning with 'app'.
        c. See composer.js to see how the application is composed.
        d. Haven't figured out all the abstractions yet.
        e. Why not available frameworks?
            Using something like Ember would have certainly helped me finish the app faster & better. However, I've been wanting to try my hand at building a framework based on es6 classes alone. 
    3. Styling
        a. App should vertically stack up in smaller screens.

Handlebars & Sass compilation:
Examples:
  ./node_modules/handlebars/bin/handlebars search-results/templates/search-results.hbs -f search-results/templates/search-results.hbs.js
  ./node_modules/node-sass/bin/node-sass travel-plan/styles/main.scss travel-plan/styles/main.css
